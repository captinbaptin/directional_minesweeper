Rules:
Each tile has 4 color coded trapezoidals and a number
The number on the tile is the sum of the number of mines times the multiplier in each of the 3 tile reigons around the tile
The regions consist of the tile sharing an edge with the trapezoid and the 2 tiles sharing a corner with the trapezoid
(Therefore the 4 regions cover the same 8 tiles as regular minesweeper AND each corner tile is part of 2 regions)
The multipliers are 
	0 green
	1 red
	2 blue
